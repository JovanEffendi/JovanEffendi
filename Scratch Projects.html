            <h2>Doodle Games - MAZE</h2>
            <h3>A Maze Game in Scratch</h3>
            <p>
            A maze game in Scratch is an interactive experience where players guide a character (sprite) through a maze to reach a goal without touching the walls. The backdrop serves as the maze. Players use keyboard inputs, like the arrow keys, to move the sprite up, down, left, or right.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> If the sprite touches a wall, it might lose a life, restart, or face a penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Levels:</strong> Completing the maze can lead to more challenging levels with narrower paths or additional obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancements:</strong> Games may include timers, scoring systems, or sound effects to make the experience more engaging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Doodle Games - Clicker</h2>
            <h3>A Clicker Game in Scratch</h3>
            <p>This game is very straightforward, with only 1 objective. To click as much as possible in a certain amount of time. Also, IT NEVER ENDS! This game was to be used as a foundation for many other games.</p>
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Button:</strong>Click the button to get points.</li>

            <h2>Doodle Games - Hoop Challenge</h2>
            <h3>A Mini-Basketball in Scratch</h3>
            <p>This basketball game is quite different than a real basketball game. Instead of the person or the basketball moving, the hoop will move randomly across the screen. Isn't that confusing? Try the game to find out!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Moving Hoop:</strong>The Basketball hoop will move in random directions across the Scratch Window.</li>
                <li><strong>Points System:</strong>The score will increase with each ball that successfully goes in the hoop.</li>
                <li><strong>Shooting:</strong>To Shoot, you have to click the spacebar.</li>
            </ul>
